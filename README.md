Hello, I'm Simon Onazi Moses! I’m a self-motivated and progress-driven person with extensive experience in the tech industry. I’ve been working with a couple of tech
companies and start-ups, for over 5 years, developing applications and leading teams. Through the course of my career, I have honed
my programming, analytics, communication, and leadership skills. I'm an astute problem-solver initiating strategies and procedures that
allow project scale with ease and support best practice development standards. and yes I love the ATOMIC design and DRY principles.
